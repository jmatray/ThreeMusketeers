# Prioritized Qualities

## 1. Correctness 
Since our project is creating and keeping track of financial reports for our users, it is most important that whatever it does it should do correctly as not to provide incorrect information
## 2. Usefulness 
If users are unable to derive any usefulness out of the project, then it is not accomplishing its goal: saving the user money
## 3. Learnability 
Since our goal is to allow users to save and spend money better, it must be easy to learn and do, otherwise it will be too similar to other money saving projects
## 4. Reliability 
We need users to have the same experience each time they use the product so the user is able to trust us to keep track of their financial situations.
## 5. User Efficiency 
Users should be able to budget their monthly income and adjust goals fairly easily and quickly in order to keep them engaged and using the website. However, when users first make an account, they have to enter in answers to a few questions, which is not super efficient. 
## 6. Accessibility 
The website should be accessible enough to appeal to the general adult population, as well as students, and is customizable to allow for a wide range of users. However, accessibility is not a very high priority because the website does not attempt to be for everyone. For example, this tool does not work for young children aiming to save money.
## 7. Robustness 
It is important that users be able to enter valid information into the forms but it is a website so operating in different environments is less important.
## 8. Security 
We want to protect users’ information like their email address. However, the application is made through Firebase so most security features are out of our control. Since the user enters in financial information instead of linking the website to their bank account, the chances of losing sensitive information is pretty low besides users’ email addresses.
## 9. Performance 
We want the website to execute tasks in a reasonable amount of time but it is not a priority for it to be as “zippy” as possible. The user will likely only be making a few adjustments or updates at a time so the time it takes to execute tasks should not take unreasonably long. 
## 10. Verifiability 
There will not be a lot of functionality occurring behind the scenes aside from fetching/pushing data and running calculations to determine budgeting amounts. Therefore, there really is not a lot of functionality that the client will not be aware of.
## 11. Maintainability
This will be a standalone project, and while writing coherent and clean code is important, there likely won’t be anyone that will maintain the code after completion who did not write it initially. 
## 12. Interoperability 
By default, we will likely use a lot of compatible interfaces. We also won’t be transferring between different systems (ex: client to servers).
## 13. Portability 
We’re designing this as a web application (in the browser), so it’s not a large concern if it does not work on mobile quite as well.
## 14. Reusability
Since this is a standalone project, whether or not the code is reusable is not really an issue.
